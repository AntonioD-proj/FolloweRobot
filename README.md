# FolloweRobot

Components used:
  4x DC motors
  2x Driver motors
  Raspberry pi 4 (2Gb version)
  Google Coral USB accelerator - to increase the video processing
  Proximity sensir
  2x16 display
  Night vision Pi Camera

This projects icludes a neural network pretrained and I managed to modify it in order to send impulses to the 4 motors available in order to follow a certain person.
The main workflow of the car is highli tied to the bounding box that is generated by the neural network. The impulses are sent accordingly to the position of the 
bounding box on the image  generated by the camera. If the bounding box is placed on the left size of the generated video image the motors shall move accordingly to 
mantain the bbox on the middle of the frame. This principle is applied to all the directions. To stop the robot I made a range of pixels where the motors should take no 
action.
